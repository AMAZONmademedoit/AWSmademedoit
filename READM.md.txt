#sandstorm verse

We were low, we were high, Jekyll, Hyde
I'll still stay by your side
You know I tried, and tried, and tried, and tried, and tried
I was wrong, you was right, justified, I was playing with fire
What a divide, divide, divide, divide, divide
Good God, these niggas is crazy
Just fight the feeling, it's all we do
Inside, it's killing me, baby
Outside I'm cucumber cool
We might just really be crazy
He might just, she might just
(Be crazy, be crazy, be crazy, be crazy)
What if I told you (what if I told you)
That I miss the old you? (That I miss the old you, baby?)
I used to hold you tight, a ride or die for life
But I couldn't mold you (I couldn't mold you)
'Cause I didn't own you, baby ('cause I didn't own you, baby)
But I'm on my own two now, I've grown to know
A lotta shit that I didn't before
My heart in your grip don't let my shit slip on the floor
I followed your drip and finally see where you goin'
I try to remember
But then I remember that you got a temper, and I got no filter
So it's like a sandstorm, when we get to blows
Can we please take it easy?
Let's just act like adults
I'ma keep it cool now
Although I know it's through now
Good God, these niggas is crazy
Just fight the feeling, it's all we do
Inside, it's killing me, baby
Outside I'm cucumber cool
We might just really be crazy
He might just, she might just
(Be crazy, crazy, crazy)
Take a piece of my love, we've been through enough stuff
We probably need to go up and away
Keep the peace, it's all love, won't be no spite
Now we need to grow up and away
Take a piece of my love, we've been through enough stuff
Probably need to grow up and away
Baby, it's too crazy, it pains me lately
