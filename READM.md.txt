#sandstorm verse

What if I told you (what if I told you)
That I miss the old you? (That I miss the old you, baby?)
I used to hold you tight, a ride or die for life
But I couldn't mold you (I couldn't mold you)
'Cause I didn't own you, baby ('cause I didn't own you, baby)
But I'm on my own two now, I've grown to know
A lotta shit that I didn't before
My heart in your grip don't let my shit slip on the floor
I followed your drip and finally see where you goin'
I try to remember
But then I remember that you got a temper, and I got no filter
So it's like a sandstorm, when we get to blows
Can we please take it easy?
Let's just act like adults
I'ma keep it cool now
Although I know it's through now
